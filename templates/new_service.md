  label: "[Service Name]"

# Provide the upstream source that lets users where they can go to get upstream details about
# the service Apprise sends notifications through/to:
source: https://url/to/official/app/this-apprise/service/supports
# the following groups are supported:
# - custom
# - social
# - general  <-- default if a 'group' is not defined
# - <Suggest a new group if you want through a new ticket>
group: "general"
schemas:
  # Optionally add insecure as an assignment to let users know that use of the protocol
  # will not perform secure transactions. If 'insecure' isn't defined, then 'secure' is implied.
  - schema://: insecure
  - schemas://

sample_urls:
  # These will automatically be rendered for users visiting the main service tab
  # Do not specify more than 4 or 5 as it tends to bloat the main display; users
  # who want to see more will read the documentation below.
  - schema://{credentials}/{targets}

# `has_*` values always default to `false` if not provided
# ---
# If the service supports attachments, set this value.  If 'has_attachments' is not defined, than
# it is presumed to be 'false' (no attachment support)
has_attachments: false

# If the Apprise service operates/supports SMS/MMS service calls
has_sms: false

# If the Apprise service supports a messaging app/solution that can be selfhosted
has_selfhosted: false

# If the Apprise service makes use of passing along a graphical representation of the notification
# type (info/warning/success/failure) then this should be set to true
has_image: false

# Define any message limits — only applicable when the user specifies
# ?overflow=truncate or ?overflow=split; otherwise the upstream service handles
# content beyond these values.  Remove this block entirely if the service has no
# known limits.
#
# limits:
#   - name: "Title"
#     max_chars: 250
#   - name: "Body"
#     max_chars: 2000

# Place a service into the graveyard by adding one of the following:
#    ended: YYYY-MM-DD
#    ended: YYYY-MM
#    ended: YYYY
